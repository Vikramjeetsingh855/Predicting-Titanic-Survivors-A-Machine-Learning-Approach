# Predicting-Titanic-Survivors-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
In this project, I applied various machine learning techniques to analyze the Titanic dataset and predict passenger survival. By leveraging algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, I explored the impact of different features, such as age, gender, and class, on survival rates.
